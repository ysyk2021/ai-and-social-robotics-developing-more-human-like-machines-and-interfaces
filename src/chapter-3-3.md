Artificial intelligence (AI) is playing an increasingly important role in social robotics, enabling social robots to perform complex tasks, interact with humans more intelligently, and adapt to changing environments and contexts. In this chapter, we will present several case studies on the use of AI in social robotics, highlighting the ways in which AI is being used to enhance the functionality and effectiveness of social robots.

Case Study 1: Pepper Robot
--------------------------

Pepper is a humanoid robot developed by Softbank Robotics that is designed to interact with humans in a variety of different settings, including retail, hospitality, and healthcare. Pepper is equipped with advanced AI technologies, including natural language processing and facial recognition, that enable it to recognize human emotions, respond to voice commands, and engage in natural-sounding conversations.

Pepper's AI capabilities have made it popular in a range of different industries, where it has been used for tasks such as greeting guests, providing customer service, and conducting health assessments. By using AI to enable Pepper to better understand and interact with humans, Softbank Robotics has created a social robot that is able to meet a wide range of user needs and preferences.

Case Study 2: Jibo Robot
------------------------

Jibo is a social robot developed by Jibo, Inc. that is designed to provide companionship and assistance to users in their homes. Jibo is equipped with a range of different AI technologies, including natural language processing, emotion recognition, and machine learning, that enable it to learn from user interactions and adapt to their preferences over time.

By using AI to enable Jibo to better understand and respond to human emotions and behaviors, Jibo, Inc. has created a social robot that is able to provide personalized and engaging interactions with users. Jibo is also able to perform a range of different tasks, including telling stories, playing games, and providing reminders, making it a versatile and useful addition to many households.

Case Study 3: Kuri Robot
------------------------

Kuri is a social robot developed by Mayfield Robotics that is designed to provide companionship and assistance to users in their homes. Kuri is equipped with a range of different AI technologies, including natural language processing, facial recognition, and machine learning, that enable it to recognize and respond to user behaviors and preferences.

By using AI to enable Kuri to better understand and interact with users, Mayfield Robotics has created a social robot that is able to provide personalized and engaging interactions with users. Kuri is also able to perform a range of different tasks, including playing music, taking photos, and monitoring the home, making it a useful and versatile addition to many households.

Conclusion
----------

AI is playing an increasingly important role in social robotics, enabling social robots to perform complex tasks, interact with humans more intelligently, and adapt to changing environments and contexts. The case studies presented here highlight some of the ways in which AI is being used to enhance the functionality and effectiveness of social robots, creating machines that are able to meet a wide range of user needs and preferences. As AI continues to evolve and improve, we can expect to see even greater possibilities for enhancing the capabilities of social robots in the future.
