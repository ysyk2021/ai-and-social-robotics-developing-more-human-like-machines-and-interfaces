**The current status of this chapter is draft. I will finish it later when I have time**

In this chapter, we explore the limitations and challenges associated with traditional approaches in the development of AI-based social robotics. We examine the shortcomings of conventional methods and highlight the need for innovative solutions to overcome these obstacles.

1. **Simplified Models and Behaviors**
--------------------------------------

* Discuss how traditional approaches often rely on simplified models and behaviors, which may not accurately capture the complexity and nuances of human interactions. Address the challenges of developing sophisticated and context-aware behaviors that enable seamless human-robot interaction.

2. **Limited Perception and Sensing Abilities**
-----------------------------------------------

* Highlight the limitations of traditional approaches in perception and sensing capabilities of social robots:
  * **Sensor Limitations**: Discuss the constraints imposed by limited sensory inputs, such as vision, audio, or tactile sensors, which can hinder the robot's ability to understand and respond appropriately to human cues.
  * **Contextual Understanding**: Address the challenge of developing algorithms that can interpret and understand the contextual information surrounding social interactions, including environmental factors and user preferences.

3. **Lack of Adaptability and Personalization**
-----------------------------------------------

* Explain how traditional approaches often lack adaptability and personalization, resulting in generic and repetitive robot behaviors. Address the challenges of developing systems that can dynamically adapt to different users, environments, and cultural contexts, providing personalized and tailored experiences.

4. **Communication and Natural Language Understanding**
-------------------------------------------------------

* Discuss the limitations of traditional approaches in communication and natural language understanding:
  * **Ambiguity and Context**: Explore the difficulties in handling linguistic ambiguity and capturing the contextual nuances of human conversations, leading to potential misunderstandings and misinterpretations.
  * **Non-Verbal Communication**: Address the challenges of incorporating non-verbal cues, such as gestures, facial expressions, and body language, into the robot's communication repertoire, enhancing its ability to express and perceive emotions.

5. **Computational and Processing Constraints**
-----------------------------------------------

* Highlight the computational and processing constraints faced by traditional approaches:
  * **Real-Time Responsiveness**: Discuss the challenge of achieving real-time responsiveness in social robots, especially when dealing with complex tasks or interacting with multiple users concurrently.
  * **Efficiency and Resource Allocation**: Address the limitations in resource allocation and efficient utilization of computational resources, considering factors such as power consumption, memory, and processing capabilities.

6. **Ethical and Social Implications**
--------------------------------------

* Examine the ethical and social implications associated with traditional approaches in AI-based social robotics:
  * **Privacy and Data Security**: Discuss concerns regarding the collection, storage, and usage of personal data by social robots, emphasizing the need for robust privacy and security measures to protect user information.
  * **Transparency and Accountability**: Address the challenges of ensuring transparency and accountability in the decision-making processes of social robots, particularly in critical scenarios or situations where human safety is involved.
  * **Social Impact and Employment**: Explore the potential impact of social robots on employment and society at large, addressing concerns about job displacement and the need for responsible integration of robots in various industries.

7. **Future Directions and Innovative Solutions**
-------------------------------------------------

* Propose future directions and innovative solutions to overcome the limitations and challenges of traditional approaches:
  * **Advanced Machine Learning Techniques**: Discuss the potential of advanced machine learning techniques, such as deep learning, reinforcement learning, and generative models, to enhance the perception, behavior, and adaptability of social robots.
  * **Multimodal Interaction and Fusion**: Explore the integration of multiple modalities, such as vision, speech, and touch, to enable richer and more natural interactions between social robots and humans.
  * **Context-Aware Systems**: Advocate for the development of context-aware systems that can understand and respond appropriately to dynamic environments, user preferences, and cultural contexts.
  * **Human-Centered Design**: Emphasize the importance of human-centered design principles, involving users in the development process, and considering their needs, values, and cultural backgrounds.

8. **Conclusion**
-----------------

* Summarize the limitations and challenges of traditional approaches in AI-based social robotics. Highlight the need for innovative solutions and future advancements to create more human-like machines and interfaces. Emphasize the importance of interdisciplinary research and collaboration to address these challenges effectively.

By understanding the limitations and challenges discussed in this chapter, researchers and developers can pave the way for new approaches and technologies that push the boundaries of AI-based social robotics, ultimately leading to more sophisticated and human-like interactions between robots and humans.
